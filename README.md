# Bank-Loan-Report
Analyzing bank loan data using EXCEL 


## Introduction:

The objective of this project was to develop an extensive bank loan report that provides critical insights into our bank's lending operations. The aim was to aid in making informed decisions, tracking the health of our loan portfolio, and identifying trends that could guide our lending strategies.


## Data Source:

The loan data for this project is sourced from an  [internal banking database](https://www.kaggle.com/),capturing comprehensive information about the bank's lending activities


## Tools Used ; EXCEL

Utilized for all data visualization and analysis aspects. EXCEL was chosen for its robust capabilities in handling  datasets and its dynamic visualization tools, which are crucial for representing complex financial data effectively. Data Analysis and Visualizations:


## Dashboards

# Dashboard 1: Summary

![summary](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b109e07-b98b-48a1-ae2b-e67131f4d371)

The Summary Dashboard captures key loan-related metrics and their changes over time, providing a snapshot of the loan portfolio's health and lending strategy impact.Visualizations included bar charts for monitoring trends over time, and donut charts for loan term distributions.It includes the following KPIs:

- Total Loan Applications
- Total Funded Amount
- Total Amount Received
- Average Interest Rate
- Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)

Additionally, it distinguishes between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans,' with specific indicators for each category, helping in the assessment of loan portfolio quality.


# Dashboard 2: Overview

The Overview Dashboard visually represents various loan-related metrics.Visualizations included line charts for monitoring trends over time,filled maps for regional analysis,and donut charts for loan term distributions.It includes the following KPIs:

- Monthly Trends by Issue Date
- Regional Analysis by State
- Loan Term Analysis
- Employment Length Analysis
- Loan Purpose Breakdown
- Home Ownership Analysis

These visualizations aid in identifying trends, seasonal patterns, and the distribution of loans across various categories.




# Dashboard 3: Details

The Details Dashboard offers a detailed view of the loan data, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan metrics, borrower profiles, and performance data.

# Data Fields and Usage

The data utilized in the dashboards comprise several fields, each serving a specific purpose in loan management and risk assessment:

- Loan ID: Unique identifier for loans.
- Address State: Borrower location for regional analysis.
- Employment Length: Indicates - employment stability.
- Grade/Sub Grade: Creditworthiness and risk classification.
- Issue Date: Loan origination date.
- Loan Status: Current state of the loan for performance tracking.
- Loan Amount: Principal amount borrowed.
- DTI: Debt burden relative to income.
- Interest Rate: Cost of borrowing.
- Term: Loan duration.
- Purpose: Loan reason for segmentation and customization.

Each field plays a crucial role in managing loans, assessing borrower risk, structuring loan terms, and making informed lending decisions.


# Implementation

The project required dataset from Excel for analysis and visualization using pivot table. Dashboards were crafted using pivot table visualization tools and analytical capabilities, aligning with the specified requirements in the problem statement and utilizing the data dictionary to ensure precise field utilization.


# Data Validation

To ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data reflected in the dashboards, a thorough data validation process was undertaken,the following measures were implemented:

- Pivot table : Used to organize and analyze data.Also used to add and remove values,and to filter and sort data sets. it was used to structure and organize data.
- KPI Logic Validation: The calculations and logic underlying the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were thoroughly reviewed.
- Cross-Verification with Source Data: The transformed data in Excel was cross-verified with the source data . This step was crucial to confirm that all data transformations, including filtering, grouping, and aggregation, were correctly applied.


Ensured that the dashboards were user-friendly and met the end-users' needs by facilitating User Acceptance Testing (UAT), where feedback was gathered to refine the visualizations. Outcome and Benefits: The project successfully delivered a detailed analytical report that improved the visibility of our loan operations. The insights generated from the Power BI dashboards have enabled us to make strategic decisions based on data-driven insights, significantly enhancing our lending practices.


## Conclusion


By incorporating robust data validation techniques, the Bank Loan Dashboard project establishes itself as a reliable and authoritative source for monitoring the bankâ€™s loan activities. The project not only presents critical data through intuitive visualizations but also guarantees the precision of the information displayed, enabling the bank to make informed and assured strategic decisions with confidence.
